#!/bin/bash

# This script is used as user data for AWS EC2 instances at first start-up.
# It installs and configures Apache HTTP server with detailed explanations and industry best practices.

# Update the system to ensure all packages are up to date.
yum update -y

# Install Apache HTTP server.
yum install -y httpd

# Start the Apache HTTP server.
systemctl start httpd

# Enable the Apache HTTP server to start on boot.
systemctl enable httpd

# Create a simple index.html file with a greeting message.
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

# Summary of actions:
# 1. The script updates the system to ensure it has the latest security patches and updates.
# 2. It installs the Apache HTTP server, a widely used and well-supported web server.
# 3. The Apache HTTP server is started to make it available for incoming connections.
# 4. The Apache HTTP server is configured to start automatically on system boot.
# 5. Finally, a basic index.html file is created in the web server's root directory, displaying a greeting message with the instance's hostname.

# Industry best practices applied:
# - Regular system updates help protect against vulnerabilities and ensure system stability.
# - Using a package manager (yum) to install software ensures that dependencies are resolved and packages are installed securely.
# - Starting and enabling services (such as httpd) through systemctl ensures proper management and control of services.
# - Providing a custom greeting message (index.html) gives a basic demonstration of web server functionality and can be expanded upon as needed.
# - Comments throughout the script explain each step for better understanding and maintainability.
