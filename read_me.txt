Make sure you have the boto3 library installed in your Cloud9 environment (pip install boto3). 
These scripts use the boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python, to interact with AWS services. 
You can execute these scripts directly in your Cloud9 environment or save them as separate Python files and run them from the terminal.
